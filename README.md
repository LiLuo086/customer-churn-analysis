ðŸ“Š Customer Churn Analysis in Excel
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical metric for telecom companies, as acquiring new customers often costs more than retaining existing ones.
In this project, I performed an exploratory churn analysis on the Databel Telecom dataset using Excel. The goal was to uncover churn patterns, calculate KPIs, and provide actionable insights for retention strategies.
