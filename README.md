# Customer Churn Analysis in Excel

## Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical metric for telecom companies, as acquiring new customers often costs more than retaining existing ones.
In this project, I performed an exploratory churn analysis on the Databel Telecom dataset using Excel. The goal was to uncover churn patterns, calculate KPIs, and provide actionable insights for retention strategies.

## Objectives

- Analyze customer churn rate and trends.

- Identify key factors that influence churn (e.g., contracts, customer service calls, data plans).

- Build an interactive Excel dashboard to summarize findings.

- Provide business recommendations based on insights.

## Dataset

Source: [Databel Telecom Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muftau/investigating-customer-churn)

The dataset contains 6,687 customer records with customer status, demographic, contract information, and subscription details.

The metadata about this dataset is stored in the file `metadata.xlsx`.

## Methodology

Steps taken in Excel:

1. Data Cleaning:

    - Removed duplicates & blanks.

    - Converted categorical fields to usable formats.

    - Handled numeric formatting (Monthly/Total Charges).

2. Exploratory Analysis:

    - Calculated churn rate.

    - Created PivotTables for churn distribution (by contract type, tenure, payment method, etc.).

    - Applied conditional formatting to highlight churn risks.

3. Visualization & Dashboard:

    - Built interactive Excel dashboard using slicers, PivotCharts, and KPIs.

    - Added trendline charts to show churn drivers.
